# CySCA 2015 Web Penetration Testing Component

### Configured for running in Vagrant by [@nickw444](https://github.com/nickw444)

### Running The Box:

1. Install [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
1. `git clone https://github.com/nickw444/CySCA2015.git`
1. `cd CySCA2015/web_application_pentest/files/`
1. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts`
1. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
1. `vagrant up` - You will be prompted for your password for a sudo command. (And will be prompted more than once. Keep your eye on it.)
This is adding `www.ecwi.cysca` and `support.ecwi.cysca` to your hosts file.
1. Wait for about 20 minutes (maybe longer?). The boxes are being provisioned.
1. Vagrant will tell you when it's done. When it is, jump to your browser and 
go to [www.ecwi.cysca](http://www.ecwi.cysca) and 
[support.ecwi.cysca](http://support.ecwi.cysca). If this didn't work, scroll down 
and take a look at the notes section.
1. (Hopefull) Start hacking!

When you're down, you can switch off the vagrant VM by typing `vagrant halt` into your terminal.

Good luck!

### Notes:

If for some reason vagrant-hostsupdater doesn't do it's job, you will need to 
modify your hosts file and add entries for `support.ecwi.cysca` and `www.ecwi.cysca`. 

Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.0.2 www.ecwi.cysca
10.10.0.3 support.ecwi.cysca
```



## Systems Needed
* WWW (www.ecwi.cysca)
* Support (support.ecwi.cysca) 

## Folders
* www_server - Files for the WWW server
* support_server - Files for the support server
