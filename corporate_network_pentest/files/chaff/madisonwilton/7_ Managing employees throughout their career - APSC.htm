<P>‘Some of the major barriers to participation in employment for people with a 
mental health condition include stigma, fear and ignorance amongst employers and 
co-workers, and inflexible and inappropriate working arrangements.’<A name="ednref2" 
title="" id="ednref2" href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/mental-health/managing-employees#edn2">1</A></P>
<H2>Why it matters</H2>
<P>Employment is generally good for a person’s health and well-being<A name="ednref3" 
title="" id="ednref3" href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/mental-health/managing-employees#edn3">2</A>; 
however, poor health, including mental ill health, is often a barrier to 
obtaining employment and participating in good quality work.<A name="ednref4" 
title="" id="ednref4" href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/mental-health/managing-employees#edn4">3</A> 
Overcoming discrimination is essential in helping people with mental health 
conditions to get work and to keep it. The APS is committed to diversity and 
ensuring equal opportunities in employment and career opportunities for those 
with mental health conditions.</P>
<H2>How it’s done</H2>
<H3>Recruitment</H3>
<P>Under Commonwealth anti-discrimination law, people with ‘disability’ includes 
people with mental health conditions. This provides legal safeguards to protect 
people against discrimination through the recruitment process. While those 
safeguards are important, good practice often calls us to go beyond bare legal 
obligations to plan for positive and encouraging recruitment processes for 
people with mental health conditions.</P>
<DIV class="highlight">
<P>The ability to make reasonable adjustments enables you to confidently recruit 
people with a diverse range of health conditions, including people with 
adjustment requests related to mental health.</P></DIV>
<P>Many employees will not reveal a prior mental health condition before they 
are selected for a role because they fear indirect or unconscious bias—which is 
prevalent in broader society.</P>
<P>A person might disclose a mental health condition if they require a change or 
modification to standard employment conditions. They can ask for reasonable 
adjustments at any time, including before interview, for a change to the 
selection process. When considering what is reasonable&nbsp;take the following 
into account:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Identify inherent requirements—</STRONG>job descriptions and 
  selection criteria need to focus on the inherent requirements (what needs to 
  be achieved) of the role, not the way the role is performed.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Fairness for each applicant—</STRONG>use objective criteria and 
  value diverse experiences and backgrounds. Nothing in the APS merit principle 
  prevents managers from making adjustments to selection processes to 
  accommodate the needs of people with disability. Merit-based selection is not 
  about complying with a process but about establishing an environment where all 
  candidates can present their claims fully, without the process itself becoming 
  a barrier. The merit legislation allows for adjustments to accommodate the 
  needs of people with disability, including mental health conditions.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Ask the applicant what adjustments would be most suitable</STRONG> 
  and consult with them through the process.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Ask questions related to the ability and suitability to do the 
  job—</STRONG>you can only ask questions about disability or mental health 
  conditions if it is related to the inherent requirements of the job, or to 
  identify reasonable adjustments that can be made in the workplace to support 
  the applicant to perform the role.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Test for work related capability—</STRONG>be flexible with 
  assessment options and consider making the interview an informal chat, putting 
  a greater emphasis on referee reports, providing questions to the applicant in 
  advance and asking for answers in writing. If you become aware that a method 
  of assessment is disadvantageous to an applicant, discuss this with the 
  applicant and agree on a new method.</LI></UL>
<DIV class="highlight">
<P>‘When I was offered a job in my current agency, I disclosed that I had 
bipolar disorder. I was asked to go for a pre-employment medical assessment, 
then my offer of employment was confirmed. On my doctor’s advice, I work from 
home one day each week, and I start work late and finish late. Some of my 
medication makes me groggy in the morning, and this arrangement allows me to 
work when I am at my best.’<BR><STRONG>Clare, an APS employee</STRONG></P></DIV>
<H2>Providing opportunities for good quality work and career advancement</H2>
<P>As a manager, your role is to protect health and safety, and provide 
employees with opportunities to participate in meaningful work and career 
advancement.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Get the work balance right</STRONG> for employees by matching the 
  demands of the role to the capability of each employee.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Consider the skills, capability and learning and development 
  needs</STRONG> that would enable the employee to perform the role.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Manage work risks to mental health.</STRONG></LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Support and encourage performance</STRONG> through regular 
  conversations and feedback.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Provide opportunities for challenging tasks</STRONG> where 
  employees can learn skills and contribute to meaningful work.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Support and enable career advancement</STRONG> through higher 
  duties, moves at level and promotions based on merit.</LI></UL>
<H2>Assessing employee health</H2>
<P>There may be occasions when, as a manager, you believe that it would be 
appropriate for an assessment to be made of an employee’s fitness to perform 
their duties. If this is the case, you are advised to seek the assistance of 
your human resources team.</P>
<P>There are obvious sensitivities attached to requiring an employee to attend a 
medical assessment, and the employee should be kept fully informed of the 
reasons for this course of action and the process that will be followed.</P>
<P>The <EM>Public Service Act 1999</EM> and <EM>Public Service Regulations 
1999</EM> set out certain requirements relating to assessing the heath of an 
employee, whether as a condition of engagement or to assess the fitness for duty 
of a current employee. These requirements are summarised below.</P>
<H3>Directing existing employees to attend medical examination</H3>
<P>In accordance with the <EM>Public Service Regulations 1999</EM>, an agency 
head may direct an employee to undergo a medical examination if they believe 
that the state of health of the employee:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>may be affecting the employee’s work performance</LI>
  <LI>has caused, or may cause, the employee to have an extended absence from 
  work</LI>
  <LI>may be a danger to the employee</LI>
  <LI>has caused, or may cause, the employee to be a danger to other employees 
  or members of the public</LI>
  <LI>may be affecting the employee’s standard of conduct.</LI></UL>
<P>As part of their ‘duty of care’ responsibilities, an agency head may direct 
an employee to undergo a medical examination where they are to be assigned new 
duties and the agency head has reason to believe their state of health may 
affect their ability to perform those duties.</P>
<H3>Pre-employment health checks</H3>
<P>It is up to the agency head (or delegate) to decide what evidence they 
require to be satisfied that an employee is fit for duty. Evidence could include 
a declaration of health status, report from a treating practitioner, a medical 
examination or other specialist health professional assessment.</P>
<H3>Health clearance as a condition of engagement</H3>
<P>One purpose of a health clearance is to satisfy the agency head that the 
employee has capacity to perform their duties. Other purposes may be to find out 
any information relevant to meeting the employer’s duty of care under workplace 
health and safety legislation and to identify any reasonable adjustments that 
are needed for a person with disability. For further information see <A href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/conditions-of-engagement">‘Conditions 
of Engagement’ at www.apsc.gov.au</A>.</P>

<H3>Withdrawal of notice of resignation</H3>
<P>See the Australian Public Service Commission’s <A href="http://www.apsc.gov.au/trash/resignation">webpage 
on resignation</A>&nbsp;for full details on the issue of resignation in the 
APS.</P>
<P>In accordance with the common law, an APS employee has no unilateral right to 
withdraw a valid notice of resignation.</P>
<P>A notice of resignation may only be withdrawn with the agreement of the 
agency head. There is no requirement that an agency head agree to a valid notice 
being withdrawn—the agency head is free to decide not to agree if he or she so 
chooses. It is important to note agreement can only be given to a valid notice 
being withdrawn <STRONG>before</STRONG> it takes effect, i.e. during the notice 
period.</P>
<P>However, there are circumstances where it would generally be appropriate for 
an agency to consider agreeing to the withdrawal of a resignation.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>For example, situations may arise where an employee is in a highly 
  emotional state and they submit their resignation in the ‘heat of the 
  moment’.</LI>
  <LI>Where an employee gives notice of resignation in these circumstances, and 
  then quickly withdraws it, it would usually be appropriate for an agency head 
  to ‘allow’ the notice of resignation to be withdrawn or to treat it as invalid 
  and not accept it, and to proceed on the basis that the employment 
  relationship has not come to an end.</LI>
  <LI>Where an agency does not allow the resignation to be withdrawn, or where 
  an employee does not seek to withdraw it before the resignation takes effect, 
  the employee may still be able to argue, upon recovery from the emotional 
  state, that the resignation should be able to be retracted upon recovery from 
  the emotional condition.</LI>
  <LI>However, legal precedents indicate that the exception is narrowly confined 
  in these circumstances so that it will apply only if the notice is retracted 
  as soon as the employee recovers from the emotional condition.</LI>
  <LI>There is support for the view that the longer the time that elapses 
  between the giving of notice and the subsequent withdrawal, the more unlikely 
  that the resignation would be considered to be invalid.</LI></UL>
<P>The same reasoning would apply where a notice of resignation is provided by 
an employee following unreasonable pressure from the employer, that is, where 
elements of duress may be present.</P>
<H3>Incapacity</H3>
<P>In addition, another exception relates to situations where an employee lacks 
the capacity to resign from their employment, e.g., where an employee is 
suffering from a severe mental illness or psychological condition so that they 
could not be considered to have the required mental capacity to resign from 
their employment.</P>
<P>In these cases, the agency head should treat the notice as invalid and 
proceed on the basis that the employment contract has not been terminated. In 
some rare cases where the mental incapacity of an employee is so severe, the 
notice of resignation may be taken to be of no effect at all. In those 
circumstances, it would not be open to an agency head to ‘accept’ the notice nor 
for the employee to retract it, as for all intents and purposes it would be 
taken to have never been given at all.</P>
<P>It is particularly important that the cases involving highly emotional 
employees and employees suffering from mental incapacity are dealt with 
sensitively, and agencies may consider a range of options including the offer of 
counselling, undertaking additional enquiries into the employee's situation, 
referral to the agency's Employee Assistance Program etc, before assuming the 
resignation is effective/valid. It is strongly suggested that agencies consider 
seeking legal advice should a situation arise involving the issue of an invalid 
notice or incapacity.</P>
<H3>Termination of employment</H3>
<P>See the Australian Public Service Commission guide ‘Terminating APS 
Employment: The legislative framework’ for information on termination when there 
is an inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity.</P>
<P>Where an agency is considering offering voluntary retrenchment to an employee 
who is not fit for and not at work, the agency should be satisfied that:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the employee is excess to requirements</LI>
  <LI>the appropriateness of termination on the grounds of physical or mental 
  incapacity has been assessed and any request for invalidity retirement has 
  been considered and determined by the relevant superannuation authority</LI>
  <LI>the Commonwealth is not exposed to unnecessary or increased liability 
  arising under workers’ compensation legislation or at common law in relation 
  to an illness or injury as a result of the agency offering, and the employee 
  accepting, voluntary retrenchment.</LI>
  <LI>Consider the requirements for invalidity retirement under the employees’ 
  superannuation scheme—these are also set out in the Australian Public Service 
  Commission’s guide on terminating employment.</LI></UL>
