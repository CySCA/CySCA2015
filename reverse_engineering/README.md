CySCA2015 - Reverse Engineering
=====================================

Category Description
--------------------
There are no reverse engineers in the initiative, however they have a number of systems with incomplete documentation and one backdoored version of their software. They would like you to determine the functionality to allow them to continue to use these services.

**Disclaimer:** Many of these challenges had ports redirected during the game. So ports may not directly line up.
