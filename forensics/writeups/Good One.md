What is the root password for the box?

One approach is to crack the hash from /etc/shadow. But we will try save some time, if you go through the bash_history of the people on the box, youâ€™ll notice that admin.jerama uses su a lot. Once he made a mistake and typed his password without hitting enter. Hey, happened to me before :)

We can see the password is `2BumHe@d`.
