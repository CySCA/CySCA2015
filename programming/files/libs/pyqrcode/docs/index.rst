Welcome to PyQRCode's documentation!
************************************

The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written
in pure python. The module is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x. The
module automates most of the building process for you. Generally, QR codes can
be created using only two lines of code!

Unlike many other generators, all of the automation can be controlled manually.
You are free to set any or all of the properties of your QR code.

QR codes can be saved as SVG, EPS, PNG (by using the
`pypng <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypng/>`_ module), and plain text. PIL is
not used to render the image files. You can also display a QR code directly in
a compatible terminal.

The pyqrcode module attempts to follow the QR code standard as closely as
possible. The terminology and the encodings used in pyqrcode come directly
from the standard. This module also follows the algorithm laid out in the
standard.

Requirements
============

The pyqrcode module only requires Python 2.7 or Python 3. You may want to
install `pypng <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypng/>`_ in order to render PNG
files, but it is optional. Note, pypng is a pure python PNG writer which does
not require any other libraries.


Installation
============

Installation is simple. PyQRCode can be installed from pip using the
following command::

    $ pip install pyqrcode

Or from the command line using::

    $ python setup.py install


Usage
=====

The pyqrcode module aims to be as simple to use as possible. Below is a simple
example of creating a QR code for a URL. The code is rendered out as a black
and white scalable vector graphics file.
::

    >>> import pyqrcode
    >>> url = pyqrcode.create('http://uca.edu')
    >>> url.svg('uca-url.svg', scale=8)
    >>> print(url.terminal(quiet_zone=1))

The pyqrcode module, while easy to use, is powerful. You can set all of the
properties of the QR code. If you install the optional pypng library, you can
also render the code as a PNG image. Below is a more complex example::

    >>> big_code = pyqrcode.create('0987654321', error='L', version=27, mode='binary')
    >>> big_code.png('code.png', scale=6, module_color=[0, 0, 0, 128], background=[0xff, 0xff, 0xcc])
