CySCA2015 - Corporate Network Pentest
=====================================

Category Description
--------------------
The Chief Visionary Officer would like you to assess the security of the ECWI corporate network and explain the vulnerabilites located to non-technical staff. This will allow ECWI staff to provide sound advice to enterprises. Players should set their DNS server to 192.168.5.53

Questions
---------
* Danger Zone - Recover the list of external systems on the ECWI corporate network. The initiative's dns domain is ecwi.cysca.
* Sales Pitch - Assess the proxy server and try to gain access to the initiative's proxy's management interface. 
* Murphy's Law - Assess the proxy and determine whether you can gain root access.
* Flash Flood - Try to gain initial access into the initiative's internal network.
* Seems Legit - Assess the current HOTDESK workstation to discover and exploit vulnerabilties that an attacker could use to escalate privileges on the workstation. 
* Charlie - Now that you have gained privileged access on a local workstation, try to prove it would be possible for an attacker to gain privileged access on the ECWI.CYSCA domain.
* Dogfooding - With the ECWI.CYSCA domain well and truly compromised by the new contractors, Jeremy Amadio has said 'That's nice, but I'm sure they won't be able to compromise the DNS server in the DMZ, I wrote the management software myself'. Attempt to gain privileged access on the ECWI DNS server.
