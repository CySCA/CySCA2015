## Writeup
Once weâ€™ve identified the malicious process, we can start looking for how it was spawned in the first place. Since it was spawned through bash, we get a hint that it might have something to do with shellshock. Looking at the environment variables associated with the process 2751 we can clearly see that shellshock happened.
