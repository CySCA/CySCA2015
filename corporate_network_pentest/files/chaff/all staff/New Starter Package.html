<h1>ECWI New Starters Package</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Enterprise Cloud Wellness Initiative new starter. We really hope you enjoy you new jerb with us. We like to think of ourselves as a family. You are now a member of our family. 
Feel free to approach and talk to any of the other staff members as you get acquainted with the policies and processes of the Initiative</p>

<h2>Org Chart</h2>
<p>The Organisational chart has been relocated to the All Staff folder of the datastore on the DC filestore. Sorry</p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We make a difference. We stop davinci viruses overturning ships. We stop some kid accidently starting a global thermonuclear war. If hollywood can imagine it, we will stop it.</p>

<h2>Facilities</h2>
<p>First things first, You want to go and get your access pass and account created. See Jeremy Amadio for this. This will allow you to gain access to our offices any time of the day, any day of the week.</p>
<p>You will find that we have a fully stocked Kitchen with a Fridge, Dishwasher and a Table Tennis table. 
There is also a staff social drinks cupboard that never has the drink you want. Drinks cost twice retail price and will be taken off your paycheck.</p>
<p>The unisex toilets are located smack bang in the middle of the office. It's the clear glass cube with a toilet in it. I know what you are thinking, but don't worry. 
The glass has e-ink in it and will become opaque when you lock the door.</p>
<p>The meeting room is the other glass cube in the middle of the office (Please don't get them confused). The meeting room needs to be booked one month in advance. The CVO or Patrons can veto your meeting room booking at any time.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with a HOTDESK</h3>
<p>In our office we use a fluid workspace arrangement. This means no staff have allocated desks, so if you want to face east one day, and west the next, you CAN!. 
We use a hotdesking system. It is pretty straight forward, just fund a nice unused system to use (if there is no system available, take an unpaid day off, our shout). 
Sign in with your account on the network. Re-setup your profile and shares the way you like and then get to work. This will need to be done on each HOTDESK system you use.</p>
